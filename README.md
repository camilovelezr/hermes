## goals

- Consistent active learning and modeling interface aimed at enabling nonstandard analysis and acquisition policy? But with batteries included for standard BayesOpt or whatever
- data acquisition and wrangling with no-work FAIR backend integration
- Possibly actual ML models and bag of materials/physics tricks lives in separate module?
