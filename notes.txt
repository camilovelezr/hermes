# check why setting of values did not work
# think about logging which locations have been measured
# look for hardcoded things to remove them
# implement optional dependencies
# split QM2Beamline into separate script
# problem: at CHESS â†’> ML as a service, built
# assuming you had a pretrained DNN in pytorch or tf or some set of fct in sklearn
main difficul: need to serialize the model after trained, save it to disk as tarball
# send tarball to server, then model would be in server, until you need to predict,
# request it from that server, serverl sends to server2, unpacks, uses
# question: serialize model? pickle not good

ANDIE: for regression

ForLoop name: Exhaustive

hdf5 format? to metadata materials science, nexus file format

gpflow: fix so no longer trainable, then train (nothing happesn), then use predict
